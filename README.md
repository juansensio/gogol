# GOGOL

Game of Life in GO

- [x] [naive](./naive.go): basic implementation with arrays, for loops and if-else statements
- [ ] pad arrays to avoid if-else statements
- [x] print in terminal
- [ ] decouple simulation and visualization
- [ ] output video
- [ ] matrix-vector multiply
- [ ] sparse matrix
- [ ] matrix-vector multiply paralel
- [ ] benchmark (compare simulation speed of different implementations at different world sizes with same seed)
